## Preamble

The Parties to this Agreement,

*Being* Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as "the Convention"),

*In pursuit* of the objective of the Convention, [and being guided by its principles [and provisions], including the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, [in the light of different national circumstances],]

*Pursuant to the* Durban Platform for Enhanced Action adopted by decision 1/CP.17 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its seventeenth session,

*Recognizing* the intrinsic relationship between climate change, poverty eradication and [equitable access to] sustainable development, [reaffirming that responses to climate change shall [aim to avoid the adverse impacts of response measures, and] promote [social and economic development in harmony with nature][sustainable development]],]

*Taking* account of the specific needs [and special circumstances] of [developing country] Parties, [in accordance with the Convention] [and especially those that are particularly vulnerable][to climate related events,][including mountainous developing states],

[*Taking account also* of the [different and additional] specific needs and special [situations] [circumstances ] of [least developed country (LDC) Parties in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9 of the Convention and specific circumstances of] small island developing States (SIDS) [and least developed country (LDC) Parties],] [Africa] [and the Central American Isthmus],

*Emphasizing* the need to respond to the urgent threat of climate change on the basis of the [best available] [reliable] scientific knowledge, in particular, the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,

*Recognizing* the outcomes of the 2013–2015 review, [including the report on the structured expert dialogue on the review,]

[*Noting* that the largest share of historical global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs,]

*Recognizing* that Parties should take action to address climate change in accordance with [[relevant][evolving economic and emission] trends, which will continue to evolve post-2020] [and the principles and provisions of the Convention],

[*Emphasizing* the importance of promoting, protecting and respecting all human rights, including [to promote sustainable][the right to] development, and] [the right to health,] the rights of indigenous peoples, [climate induced] migrants [refugees and internally displaced peoples], children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations [and under occupation] [with due respect to sovereignty and territorial integrity of states], as well as promoting health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, while taking into account the needs of local communities, intergenerational equity concerns, and [the integrity of [ecosystems and] Mother Earth], when taking action to address climate change,]

*Taking into account* the imperatives of equitable access to sustainable development, and a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities.

*Recognizing* the critical importance [and [fundamental] priority] of safeguarding food security and ending hunger [consistent with the 2030 UN sustainable development agenda] [and the special characteristics of food and land]

[*Recognizing also* the [special characteristics and] [critical] importance of the conservation and enhancement[, as appropriate,] of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, [including [forests] [, oceans] [, ecological biomes] and other ecosystems, including through [landscape restoration] [REDD-plus, the Joint Mitigation and Adaptation approach for the integral and sustainable management of forests]] [, conservation of biodiversity], and the related benefits [for achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention], as well as the multiple social and environmental objectives of Parties [when managing their lands],]]

*Affirming* the importance of education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and cooperation [on climate change] at all levels on the matters addressed in this Agreement, and recognizing the [important] role of [subnational and local authorities as well as [non state actors and the private sector]] [a multiplicity of] [different] actors, 

[*Acknowledging* that putting a price on carbon is an important approach for cost-effectiveness of the cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions,]
